In anticipation of [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/) kicking off on Monday, Drone is announcing cloud native CI/CD for Google Cloud. Today, Drone users can confidently deploy and automate builds to [Google Cloud Storage](http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-gcs/), [Google Container Registry](http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-gcr/), [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://github.com/nytimes/drone-gke), [Google App Engine](https://github.com/NYTimes/drone-gae) and [Google Deployment Manager](https://github.com/NYTimes/drone-gdm). In addition to our deployment plug-ins above, today we’re also announcing [Drone Autoscale for Google Cloud](https://autoscale.drone.io/intro/google/) to help Google Cloud users maximize their server capacity while lowering their monthly server bill. Teams have reported handling 5 times the build volume without increasing monthly server costs.

Drone is the modern CI/CD platform providing the most plug-ins available to Google Cloud users, helping developers ship their features and bug fixes in minutes into production on Google Cloud. Implementing Drone into a deployment workflow allows enterprises to have significant advantage bringing applications to market quickly, as well as reducing costs along the way.

Container-native and works with any language that runs inside a container, Drone’s CI/CD platform is available to the open source community, as well available via an Enterprise on-prem edition.

## Google Kubernetes Engine and Google App Engine Drone Plug-Ins Now Stable

The community has been a driver in making many of the Drone plug-ins available. The NY Times created the Drone Kubernetes Engine and Google App Engine plug-in. We are thankful for their community contribution and today are excited to announce that the plug-ins are now stable. The NY Times blogged about this [here](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/continuous-deployment-to-google-cloud-platform-with-drone/).
